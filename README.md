## ICEBOX_

- Combine any product below with molle webbing. For example: hoddies with molle slots for attachments.
- Evo Attachment Extension - conversion kit to "kannibalize" other bags and items so they can be used as modular.
- Affector / Special Edition 
like below wrapped in plastic at the top, velcro at the bottom (foiled, laminated but not fully, round the edges).

It would look something like this:
_^^^^^^^^^^^^_

- orange reinforced paper bands with modern tags (PROTOTYPE / FPN 084-22-1838)
- think more about the naming scheme
- correct the logo
- clarify the goal from core drives
- mission statement
- material selection
- Write down seasons.
